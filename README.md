# Year-Classification-mortality-rate-continents
- The national child birth compatibility rate is a major factor in determining the success of 
country in human resource management. It is used to estimate the number of deaths per thousand in a 
country within the age of 0-5 years. The classification of continents based on its suitability to live can 
be determined by child mortality rate. Machine learning using logistic regression can be used to 
classify a continent based on child mortality rate. The classification will be based on weather a 
country is suitable for child birth or not. In this work we will try to classify on the basis of year and 
deaths due to different disease  for the world to be suitable place for child birth. Machine learning using 
logistic regression can be used to classify the aforementioned issue. In this work the analysis of our 
logistic regression model with the methodology used is discussed. We have python and its supporting 
libraries to carry out the task
